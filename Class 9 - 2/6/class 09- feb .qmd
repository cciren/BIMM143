Here we analyze a candy dataset from the 538 website. This is a CSV file from their GitHub yesterday

##Data Import

```{r}
candy <- read.csv("candy-data.csv",row.names = 1)
head(candy)
```
> Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset?

```{r}
nrow(candy)

```

85 candy types

> Q2. How many fruity candy types are in the dataset?

```{r}
sum(candy$fruity)
```
38 fruity candy types 

##Data Exploration
> Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it’s winpercent value?

```{r}
candy["Twix", ]$winpercent
```


> Q4. What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?

```{r}
candy["Kit Kat", ]$winpercent
```
76.7686

> Q5. What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?

```{r}
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars", ]$winpercent
```
49.6535

```{r}
library("skimr")
skim(candy)
```
```{r}
x<- c(5, 3, 4, 1)
sort(x)
order(x)
#order()is the index position of the number 
```
```{r}
inds<- order(candy$winpercent)
head(candy[inds,])
```

```{r}
skimr::skim(candy)
```

> Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

winpercent looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset (the mean is 50.32 compares to the other)

> Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy$chocolate column?

a zero means it is not chocolate candy, a one represents it is a chocolate

> Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

```{r}
hist(candy$winpercent, breaks=8)
```

> Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

No, the distribution of winpercent do not value symmetrical (it is skewed)

> Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

The center is below 50%

> Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

```{r}

#first find all chocolate candy and their $winpercent values
#Next summarize these values into one number
# Then do the same for fruit candy and compare the numbers

mean(candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$chocolate)])
mean(candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$fruity)])

```
```{r}
choc.inds<- as.logical(candy$chocolate)
choc.win<- candy[choc.inds, ]$winpercent
mean(choc.win)
```

Chocolate candy is higher ranked than fruit candy 

> Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

```{r}
t.test(candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$chocolate)],candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$fruity)] )

```

The p-value is 2.871e-08, therefore it is statistically significant. 

> Q13. What are the five least liked candy types in this set?

```{r}
head(candy[order(candy$winpercent),], n=5)
```

Nik L Nip, Boston Baked Beans, Chiclets, Super Bubble, Jawbusters

> Q14. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?

```{r}
head(candy[order(candy$winpercent, decreasing = TRUE),], n=5)
```
Reese's Peanut Butter cup, Reese's Miniatures, Twix, Kit Kat, Snickers

> Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(candy)+
  aes(winpercent, rownames(candy))+
  geom_col()

```
>Q16. This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars sorted by winpercent?

```{r}
ggplot(candy)+
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent))+
  geom_col()+
  labs(x = "Win Percent", y = NULL)

ggsave('barplot1.png', width =7, height = 10)
```
![](barplot1.png)

Add some color to our ggplot. We need to make a custom color vector

```{r}
# Start with all black vector of colors 
my_cols <- rep("black", nrow(candy))
my_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] = "chocolate"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] = "brown"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] = "pink"
```

```{r}
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill=my_cols) 
```
> Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

Sixlets

> Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

Starburst

#Taking a look at pricepercent
```{r}
candy$pricepercent
```
If we want to see what is a good candy to buy in terms of winpercent and pricepercent we can plot these two variables and then see the best candy for the least amount of money 

To avoid the overplotting if all these labels we can use an add on package called ggrepel

Play with 'max.overlaps' and 

```{r}
library(ggrepel)

#Change the color of fruity candies since it is too hard to visualize
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] = "red"

ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) + 
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols, size=3.3, max.overlaps = 200)
```

> Q19. Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms of winpercent for the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your buck?

```{r}
ord <- order(candy$winpercent, candy$pricepercent)
head(candy[ord[1],])
```


> Q20. What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and of these which is the least popular?

```{r}
ord <- order(candy$pricepercent, decreasing = TRUE)
head(candy[ord,c(11,12)], n=5)
```

# Exploring the correlation structure 

```{r}
library(corrplot)
cij <- cor(candy)
corrplot(cij)
```
# The top half is the same as the lower half

> Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?

fruit and chocolate are the most anti-correlated two variables 

> Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?

bar with chocolate are the most positively correlated two variables.

# On to PCA

the main function for this is called 'prcom()' and here we know we need to scale our data with 'scale = TRUE' argument.

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale = TRUE)
summary(pca)
```

Score main PCA score plot of PC1 vs PC2 

```{r}
plot(pca$x[,1:2])
```
Change the plotting character and add some color

```{r}
plot(pca$x[,1:2], col=my_cols, pch=16)
```
```{r}
# Make a new data-frame with our PCA results and candy data
my_data <- cbind(candy, pca$x[,1:3])
p <- ggplot(my_data) + 
        aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, 
            size=winpercent/100,  
            text=rownames(my_data),
            label=rownames(my_data)) +
        geom_point(col=my_cols)

p
```


```{r}
library(ggrepel)

p + geom_text_repel(size=3.3, col=my_cols, max.overlaps = 200)  + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title="Halloween Candy PCA Space",
       subtitle="Colored by type: chocolate bar (dark brown), chocolate other (light brown), fruity (red), other (black)",
       caption="Data from 538")

```
## loadings plot 

```{r}
loadings <- as.data.frame (pca$rotation)

ggplot(loadings)+
  aes(PC1, reorder(rownames(loadings), PC1))+
  geom_col()
```
```{r}
#library(plotly)
#ggplotly(p)
par(mar=c(8,4,2,2))
barplot(pca$rotation[,1], las=2, ylab="PC1 Contribution")
```

> Q24. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction? Do these make sense to you?

Fruity candies, hard, pluribus are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive position. It maked sense to me since Fruity candies are most favorable to be in package and in a hard structure
